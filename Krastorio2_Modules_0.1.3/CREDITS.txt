Special thanks to Krastor and Linver for developing Krastorio 2.

This mod is an add-on for Krastorio 2 by Krastor and Linver.
My mod is not an official expansion to Krastorio 2. It requires Krastorio 2 to 
be installed, but it is not related to the Krastorio Team in any other way.

The graphics, other than the ones stated below, are edited versions of graphics 
from the factorio base game.



The icon graphics for the energy processing circuits were created by Kirazy. I 
only modified the hue. They include all pngs inside the folder with the path:
__Krastorio2_Modules__/graphics/icons/energy-processing-circuit
