# Krastorio 2 Modules
Krastorio 2 expands a lot of vanilla features but leaves the module system unchanged. The Krastorio team stated that this decision was made because of balancing reasons, which I can fully understand. However, for those (like me) who still wish for more tiers of modules to extend the endgame and increase production even further, this is the mod for you.

This mod expands the 3 types of base game modules by adding 3 new tiers of modules. They are powerful, but also very expensive to craft. They are designed as an endgame resource sink that allows you to push your factory even further and save you a few UPS.
Their high cost forces you to use them sparingly and conscientiously, instead of spamming them around every single setup like the base game tier of modules.
The difference between other mods that add more modules and this mod is that it was designed specifically for Krastorio 2. It makes use of the new resources and items and keeps close to the vanilla style. 
# Settings
This mod adds a number of options that allow you to customize the bonuses of the new modules and enable/disable certain features individually.
You donâ€™t like a feature? You think one of the new modules is too weak or too strong?
Takes a look at the settings. Hover your cursor over them to receive a more in-depth description.
One option that should be mentioned specifically is a fix to solve the issue of some recipes reaching the cap of 1 craft per tick. 
With the new modules fully beaconed Advanced assembling machines or Advanced chemical plants can reach craft speeds of 141 or 266 respectively, causing some recipes to go over 60 operations per second and making the game engine not iterate all recipe cycles correctly. 
While this setting is not enabled by default because it is not necessary for normal gameplay, it is advised to enable it once you reach the endgame and start using fully beaconed setups with the new modules of this mod.

My mod is not an official expansion to Krastorio 2. It requires Krastorio 2 to be installed, but it is not related to the Krastorio Team in any other way.
The code was created by me and graphics are based on vanilla icons and edited by me.
Thank you [billbo99](https://mods.factorio.com/user/billbo99) for allowing me to use your script to generate icons for the stacked version of items for [Deadlock's Stacking Beltboxes & Compact Loaders](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/deadlock-beltboxes-loaders) support.
